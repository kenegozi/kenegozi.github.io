ActiveWriter is a VS2005 plugin, that adds a new item type for your projects. This item is actually a visual designer for ActiveRecord classes. Quite neat, and hopefully will increase the penetration of Castle's ActiveRecord to the "If there's no VS wizard, I do not use it" kinda guys.

You can read about it and download it from [http://altinoren.com/activewriter/](http://altinoren.com/activewriter/)
