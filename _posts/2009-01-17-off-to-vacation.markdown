I like the 'smell' of the airport.

I'll be spending the following week on a snowboard, and the guesthouse I'll be at has no internet access, so if you see me ignore emails, castle's usergroups, facebook 'join XYZ group' invitations etc., don't take it personally.

Except the facebook thing, I rarely join any group, cause or application. only friends requests (from people I know), thank you.



I might have a little time to post some more while waiting in the airport lounge, but don't count on that.
