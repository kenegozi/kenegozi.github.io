The title say it all.

I really hope that IE6 would be obsolete as soon as possible. It would make writing decent markup much easier, not needing to look out for weird IE6 quirks. Also, won't need to hack my way into look at pages in IE6 (since my machine has IE7 for some time now)

Last month's IE visitors to my site (according to google analytics):
- IE7 - 64.46%
- IE6 - 35.47%
- IE5.01- 0.06% (WTF? who uses that?)

I really hope that soon enough IE6 would join IE5 in the not-important area.



btw, IE visitors in total are 45.51%, so IE6 visitors are only 16%. wow. that's good, especially since the DotNetKick widget does not render well on IE6 and I never found time to fix that. I guess I'm not going to ...
