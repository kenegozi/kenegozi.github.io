Following users requests, I have just posted two documents to using.castleproject.org.

The first is an explanation about the CodeGenerator (from Contrib), and another one, on using the DictionaryAdapter.

Here are the links:

- [http://using.castleproject.org/display/Contrib/Castle.Tools.CodeGenerator](http://using.castleproject.org/display/Contrib/Castle.Tools.CodeGenerator)
- [http://using.castleproject.org/display/Comp/Castle.Tools.DictionaryAdapter](http://using.castleproject.org/display/Comp/Castle.Tools.DictionaryAdapter)
