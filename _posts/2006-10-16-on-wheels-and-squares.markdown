On a small debate with a friend, about weather he should design and implement a Data Access Layer himself, or use an existing framework, I came across a piece by [Ayende](http://www.ayende.com/Blog) about [25 Reasons Not To Write Your Own Object Relational Mapper](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/25ReasonsNotToWriteYourOwnObjectRelationalMapper.aspx).

I'd like to add a quote from [Code Complete 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCode-Complete-Second-Steve-McConnell%2Fdp%2F0735619670%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1161008471%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=kenegoziswebl-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kenegoziswebl-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1) about programmers who are reluctant to read (and use) existing solutions to known problems (on p. 823): 

... even if you want to reinvent the wheel, you can't count on success. You might reinvent the square instead.

It's definitely not a [Dave Barry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Dave%20Barry&amp;tag=kenegoziswebl-20&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kenegoziswebl-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1) kinda funny punch line, however it's very much to-the-point.
