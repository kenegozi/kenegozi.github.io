So long dasBlog. It was great to have you, but it's time to move on.

After a lot of work, I am proud to announce that my blog is running on MonoRail, using AspView for the views, and ActiveRecord to do DB stuff.

Not too fancy codewise, since I have very little spare time.

Most of the time spent on the blog upgrade process was on:

1. Exporting the data from the "old" blog, and

2. making a decent markup and design for the new one.

oh. and 3. letting WindowsLiveWriter do the edits, since I wasn't in the mood to create a backoffice.

I'll blog more about the process, and I'll make the source available.

Please leave your comments here about the overall look'n'feel. There must be tons of bugs and I want your feedback.
