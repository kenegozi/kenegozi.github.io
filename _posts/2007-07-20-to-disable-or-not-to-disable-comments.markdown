I used to get a lot of spam through pingbacks/trackbacks, so I turned them off. Actually, on my current blog engine, they are not even implemented.

Reading [this post from Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html), I am thinking about disabling comments altogether (I do not get many, anyway), so if anybody would like to comment, she'll send me an email (to 'blog at mydomain-name') or use a "contact me" form, and if it will be something worthwhile, I'll do a followup post with the important comments that my alert reader has sent me.

What you think? (you can say that in an email, and even through a comment ;) )
