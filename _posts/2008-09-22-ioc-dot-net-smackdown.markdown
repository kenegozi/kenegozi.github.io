I've just came across a comparison on IoC containers in the .NET world:

- [http://blog.ashmind.com/index.php/2008/08/19/comparing-net-di-ioc-frameworks-part-1/](http://blog.ashmind.com/index.php/2008/08/19/comparing-net-di-ioc-frameworks-part-1/)
- [http://blog.ashmind.com/index.php/2008/09/08/comparing-net-di-ioc-frameworks-part-2/](http://blog.ashmind.com/index.php/2008/09/08/comparing-net-di-ioc-frameworks-part-2/)




Haven't read it yet cuz Im actually off-computer right now (the lappy is attached to the living room TV, and the break in the movie is almost over), but MAN is has COLOUR charts, so you can [bet your arse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309356/) I'm gonna read it later.



Not that I'm excited. I'm pretty sure that (INSERT WINNER HERE LATER) will prove to be the best IoC ever.
