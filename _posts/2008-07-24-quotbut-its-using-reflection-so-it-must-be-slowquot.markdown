Well, [not *that* slow apparently](http://darioquintana.com.ar/blogging/?p=43). 



The lesson:

Don't be afraid of powerful tools. 

You can use reflection right, gain the power, while not losing too much performance.



Quoting from nhusers mailing list:

How much you be scare about the use of reflection in NH if 1.000.000 of access to get &amp; set to a field mean 0.2seconds ?-- Fabio Maulo
