Today I opened a GoGrid account, as I'm looking for quite some time to upgrade my hosted environment.



Setting up the account was a breeze, and in a few minutes from starting the process I had a running instance of vs2008 64bit, with IIS and MSSql2005 express.







First impressions:



Good:

- Quick, easy to use control panel, pricing seem reasonable
- The image contains .net 3.0, and lack some updates so 3.5 was not installing until I allowed all of the windows update stuff to do the magic first.
- Online chat is helpful and very responsive. I did not need any actual tech help yet though.


Bad:

- They charge for offline machines, so you can't just turn on and off the machines, but you have to delete machines that are not in use, and in case you want to re-add them you have to recreate a new machine from their image, then running updates, installs, DB setup etc from scratch




That's it for now
