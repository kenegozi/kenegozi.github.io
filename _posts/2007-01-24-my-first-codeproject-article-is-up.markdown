I've [posted an article to CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Ajax/CoolNSimpleGoogleAJAX.asp) about [building my Google Ajax Search Enabled](http://kenegozi.com/blog/2007/01/15/GoogleAJAXSearchAPIAndMyNewHomepage.aspx)[Homepage](http://kenegozi.com/).

So, go there, read it, comment it, vote for it, tell your friends about it, print it and glue it to your forehead, whatever you think is appropriate.

Unless you didn't like it. In that case, you shouldn't do anything. why bother ? :)
