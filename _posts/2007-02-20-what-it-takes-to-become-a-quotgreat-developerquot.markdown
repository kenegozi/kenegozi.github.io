[Oren](http://www.lnbogen.com/) has [blogged about his "10 rules" for that](http://www.lnbogen.com/WhatItTakesToBecomeAGreatDeveloper.aspx).True words.My 0.02$ are:11. Believe in yourself and in your ability to become a "great developer".12. Be able to accept changes. 13. Be able to accept that the solution you are familiar with is not the "silver bullet" for every scenario. 14. Do not be afraid of new technologies - there are programming languages without curly brackets, and they be a better solution for your problem.15. Set high standards for yourself.16. Motivate yourself to keep those high standards. You can either start a blog, initiate a tech-y startup, or marry someone with a Polish mom. Anything that would drive to to excel.
