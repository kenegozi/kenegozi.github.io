I've read [an interesting post](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=E87D47E5-E7F2-99DF-3AE75A880501B215&amp;ref=rss) today on Scientific American.

They say that researchers are after a way to deliver power wirelessly to devices.

So in the near future I'll be able to use my laptop without worrying for power supply cords. Just turn it on and start to work. no need to dim the screen or scale down the cpu.
