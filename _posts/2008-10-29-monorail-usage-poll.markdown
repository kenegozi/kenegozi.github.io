Following [my last post](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2008/10/29/introducing-monorail-project.aspx), I've put up a quick poll for trying to grasp some knowledge about the way people are using (or not using) MonoRail.



It's not complete, and there will be further polls as I can already think of questions I have for the community, that did not make their way to this poll, and are very important imo.



So, if you care for the future of MonoRail, please do spare some moments to fill in the poll. Be nice and write down your feelings, pain-points and general rants in the text areas. I won't be offended by anything.



No personal details will be published (at least not deliberately - and I don't believe anyone will hack into the lousy SQL server it's stored on).



so, without further ado, I give you the poll:
