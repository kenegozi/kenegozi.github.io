As I'm trying to avoid xml files as much as possible, when I do find the need to xpath, I always need to refresh my memory on the matter.



Today I've been working with kml files, and the need for some simple xpath queries came up, forcing me to do some trial-and-error in an area I don't really like ...



Next time I'll have [Visual XPath](http://weblogs.asp.net/nleghari/articles/visualxpath.aspx) to help me with that.
