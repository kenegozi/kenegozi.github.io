I've been on a trip to Rhodes for the last few days, so no progress on Monorail or any other technical stuff was happening, but I do have a few pictures to share. It would take some time to post, since I have some projects that needs some working on, but eventually you'll be able to see the great pictures (taken on my lousy nokia phone's camera) and read some (not so funny) stories.
