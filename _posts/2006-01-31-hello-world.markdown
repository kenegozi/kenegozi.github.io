Hello everyone.

I'm starting my new blog today, and I still have some configuration problems, but I hope to be up and running in a matter of days.

{% highlight c# %}
class HelloWorld
{
   static void Main()
   {
      System.Console.Write("Hello World!");
   }
}{% endhighlight %}

Keep on the good code,

Ken
