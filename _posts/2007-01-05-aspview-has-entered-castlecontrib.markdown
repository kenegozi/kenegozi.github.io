After hammet's approval, I hav finallyadded AspView source to the Castle Project's Contrib section of the subversion repository.

Thank hammet and the rest of the Castle crew for voting for that.

So from now on, you'd be able to grab the sources from [http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/viewengines/aspview/](http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/viewengines/aspview/)

Two last comments:1.The latest edition works with Castle's trunk from build 229.2. The latest additions are supporting "~" as a macro for siteRoot, and "~~" as a fullSiteRoot (~ would expand to the virtual directory, and ~~ would expand to full url- http://...).
