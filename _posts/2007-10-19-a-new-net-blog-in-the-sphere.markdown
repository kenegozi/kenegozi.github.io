Ithink I'm going to like [this one](http://blog.softwareishardwork.com/), since he showed some (simple but interesting) ILDASM output [on his second post](http://blog.softwareishardwork.com/2007/10/c-compiler-and-infinite-iterating.html).



Found him through [JoeyDotNet](http://joeydotnet.com/blog/Default.aspx).



UPDATE:

The link to D. P. Bullington's blog is now fixed.
