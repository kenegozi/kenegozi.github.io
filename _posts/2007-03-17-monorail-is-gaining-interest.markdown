I'd like to point you to a [new podcast from HanselMinutes, about MonoRail](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=71). Scott Hanselman is interviewing a couple of guys from Eluetian as MonoRail Power Users. Theyare doing a lot of workwith MonoRail using Brail. 

Listen to that if you want to hear about how simple MVC for ASP.NET can be.

Actually, It seams that it is getting so much attention, that even MSFT are thinking about implementing something Rails-i in the future ASP.NET. [Read this if you do not believe me](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/03/16/Big-News-_2D00_-MVC-framework-for-ASP.NET-in-the-works-_2D00_-level-300.aspx).
