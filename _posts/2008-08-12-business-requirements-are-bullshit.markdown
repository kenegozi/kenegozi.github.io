yippee - Steve Yegge has published a new post, which is always a treat to read.

This time, I was delighted enough simply by reading the title: [Business requirements are bullshit](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html)



And that's after my wife has just returned from work, doing as part of a S.A.P. team, some massive blue-prints work. Ha ha.
