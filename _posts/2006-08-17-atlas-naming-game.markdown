There is a nice post about naming the Atlas package, at [http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/08/16/Atlas_Naming_Game.aspx](http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/08/16/Atlas_Naming_Game.aspx)

There are some funny comments there, so do not miss.

And that is my comment:

"I think that too descriptive names suck.

I'd go with any non-descriptive name, such as the ones MS uses as codenames (I loved Avalon and so on).I believe that from the marketing point of view, non-descriptive catchy names ar far better than the others.It's like dice.com and monster.com doesn't include "job" in their name.

But since MS are determined to use descriptive names, at least they should concentrate on the "what" and not on the "how".so "Async XmlHttp Enabled Web Apps" (AXEWA ?) is bad, while "Dynamic Web Browsing" is better."
