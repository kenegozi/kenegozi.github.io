I'm writing this very post on Windows Live Writer.

In case you'd ask, I'm using the latest public version, which is not a Beta anymore (I think): 

![WLW version](http://kenegozi.com/blog/uploaded/windowslivewriter/acallforimprovementsonwindowslivewriter_833e/016f30f5-6d4e-4735-9fb8-8123968f12b7.png)



I've also just recommended WLW for a new blogger.

however, there are still some annoying things here, that I might've liked fixed.
- XHTML output. I said something about it, then [Joe Cheng ](http://jcheng.wordpress.com)from the WLW team commented:![WLW xhtml quote](http://kenegozi.com/blog/uploaded/windowslivewriter/acallforimprovementsonwindowslivewriter_833e/c45a2b7b-3841-4db2-a8a4-f97a84a3cd86.png)However, I'd like to show you a bit from this very post :![WLW Not closing tags](http://kenegozi.com/blog/uploaded/windowslivewriter/acallforimprovementsonwindowslivewriter_833e/87775714-6a3d-4897-880b-e2a1a18c33d2.png)Now you believe me?I believe this is a fairly simple thing to fix, as those two (img and br) are simple tags, so no need to handle nesting tags, etc. 
- Search and Replace (Ctrl+H).Come on, even Notepad.exe has it.


How I wish it was an Open Source product ...
