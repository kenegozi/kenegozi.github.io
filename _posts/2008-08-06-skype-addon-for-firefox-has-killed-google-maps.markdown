I'm a big fan of google maps. A simple and yet very effective tool. I wish they had maps for Israel too ...



Anyway, I noticed today that the maps do not load on my FF. started disabling addons one by one (you'd usually blame FireBug ...) but I found out that it was the skype plugin's fault.



hmm. Im not really using it much anyway, and for the rare cases I do need to phone someone abroad, I guess I'll copy and paste into skype.
