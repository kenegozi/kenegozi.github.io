I'm really pleased to announce that there is going to be an Alt.Net conference in Israel, namely Alt.Net.Israel.

&#160;
So what is Alt.Net?
If you haven't heard of Alt.Net yet, read David Laribee's post to better understand the term - [What's ALT.NET](http://laribee.com/blog/2007/04/10/altnet/)

&#160;
Details:
The conference will be held on Thursday 7th and Friday 8st August 2008, at the [SQLink](http://www.sqlink.com/)&#160;[offices in Ramat Gan](http://www.ymap.co.il/Navigate.aspx?banner=1841&amp;origin=0&amp;SearchForParams=Y&amp;tab=1&amp;CityNmS=%u05E8%u05DE%u05EA%20%u05D2%u05DF&amp;StreetNmS=%u05D4%u05D9%u05E6%u05D9%u05E8%u05D4&amp;HouseNbrS=3&amp;Mode=1), and is being organised by [Roy Osherove](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/), [Oren Eini (a.k.a Ayende)](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/), and myself.

&#160;

Thursday 7th, at 18:30-20:30: planning meeting, following a walk to a nearby pub or coffee shop to socialise.

&#160;

Friday 8th, at 09:30-16:30: sessions.

&#160;

We have chosen a summer Friday and a super accessible location on purpose, to give the religious people a chance to attend and still make it on time home for Sabbath.

&#160;
Agenda:
That is really up to the people who attend.&#160; We will be following an [open spaces format](http://www.openspaceworld.org/cgi/wiki.cgi?AboutOpenSpace), similar to the other alt.net conferences in the UK, USA and Canada, where the agenda is decided by the conference participants.&#160; Anyone can lead sessions on particular topics of interest, participate as an attendee or just hang around and chat with interesting people.

&#160;

Please note that registration is **not** open yet!&#160; I will blog more when we have information on this, hopefully it will open shortly. I can say that the conference will be free of charge.

&#160;

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. I'm really looking forward to this, should be a great event!

&#160;

P.S, also a big thankyou to [Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/), of the alt.net UK organisers, which is partly responsible for my enthusiasm for alt.net conferences, and I've also used his previous announcement as a template for this one ...
