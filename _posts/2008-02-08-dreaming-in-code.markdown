[I guess we are all crazy](http://blog.bits-in-motion.com/2008/02/crazyness.html).

I swear that this post's content is true: 

I certainly remember a few occurrences of going to sleep with some coding/design problem or idea (of late - [SQL Query Generator](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2008/01/19/sql-query-genrator.aspx)), just to wake up with a solution. I also tend to wake up from disturbing dreams, with some of those being just the regular night horrors, but at times they involve irresolvable build errors, ASP.NET yellow screens, and TortoiseSVN irritating noises.

Anyone like to share his Coding Dreams?
