I've just stumbled upon an [old post on this very blog](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2006/10/26/monorail-vs-webforms.aspx).



In the post I actually quote a comment I have left on Ayende's blog. The nice excerpt from there:



Maybe having a ViewEngine that's use c# or VB.NET instead of boo (not the WebForm ViewEngine which suck, but somthing similar to Brail)



This was on 26/10/2006 ...



Three weeks later (on 14/11/2006) [I've announced AspView](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2006/11/14/aspview-yet-another-monorail-viewengine.aspx), after starting working with the first bits for my employer at the time, [SQLink](http://www.sqlink.com/)



Two days later I have made a [first release](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2006/11/16/aspview-first-release.aspx) public.



on 01/12/2006 I was granted a Write access to castle/contrib - AspView started gaining some recognition from the community



The rest is history. You can follow [on the AspView tag here](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/Tag/aspview.aspx)



What's there to come? stay tuned and find out
