I'm attending Google Developer Day 2008 in Israel today. It's my first large non-Microsoft event I'm being at.



I'm gonna look into the App Engine track, continuing my interest in the new Microsoft Azure platform. Computing in the cloud is something I consider very important for business applications, and plays nicely with doing SaaS solutions, which is one of my interests lately.
