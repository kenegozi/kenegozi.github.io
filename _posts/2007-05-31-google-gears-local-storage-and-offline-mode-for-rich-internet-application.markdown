Wow.

Another great tool from Google.



[http://gears.google.com/](http://gears.google.com/)



Works on Win/Mac/Linux, for IE and FF.



In a few words - it can give you offline browsing, plus local storage using SQLite (so you can run SQL queries strait from your javascript to query the local store)



I wonder what secutiry issues can come up. However, it looks very cool, and can help bring power to existing DHTML/Ajax apps.



Makes me think. Now that you do SQL from javascript, isn't it time forJsHibernate? and what about an ActiveRecord inplementation in javascript?



So, in the Flex/Silverlight war, it seams that Google is gonna win again ...
