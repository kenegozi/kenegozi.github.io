Ok. After some delay (couldn't get Internet Connection at my mother in-law's house), here are the links from my MonoRail / AspView talk:

1. [The slides](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/Files/download.aspx?filename=MonoRail-AspView-Presentation.zip) (used the newly released StarOffice from Google Apps. Should show ok in Powerpoint)

2. [A zip file](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/Files/download.aspx?filename=AspView-for-castle-rev4016-build472.zip), containing AspView built against MonoRail from revision 4016 (build no. 472), including a skeleton web project (as shown on my talk), the minimal castle dll's needed to run the skeleton project and links to Castle's build server (to get the full castle libraries) and to my blog.
