My mate, [Oren](http://www.lnbogen.com/), has recently started digging deep into TDD, with the coaching of [Roy Osherov](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/), and started [giving his insights on his blog](http://www.lnbogen.com/TDDInTheEyesOfASimplemindedPart1TheNameResolver.aspx).

As Roy mentiones on his blog, Oren's way of writing about his experience with TDD, is clear and enjoyable, therefore I'd recommend on reading is upcoming posts on the subject. It's going to be fun, I promise.


updated:The link to Oren's first post was fixed, and I am adding two more links: to the [series preface, and to the second post in the series.](http://www.lnbogen.com/TDDInTheEyesOfASimplemindedPreface.aspx)
