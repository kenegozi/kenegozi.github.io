After a long huge wait, finally Monorail 2.0 is out, get yours from&#160; [https://sourceforge.net/projects/castleproject/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/castleproject/files/)

&#160;

HUGE thanks to John Simons and the rest of the Castle project committers, plus the rest of the good people that have supplied us with patches, bug fixes, and whatnot.

&#160;

This move somewhat concludes the move from the old 1.0RC3 release from 2007, to the new releases of the Castle stack about two years afterwards.

&#160;

I'm going to follow up with a couple of “what's new”, “how-to upgrade” and “why the hell did it take so long” posts soon, so keep watching.
