I've just noticed two sites that uses AspView vienegine (of course they're on MonoRail)

The first, [https://www.musicglue.com/](https://www.musicglue.com/), has the static "home-page" stuff being served from a standard webforms aspx files. The Signup Procees however, and other applicative parts are using MonoRail, with AspView based views. The team behind this site said to me that they're moving to a complete MonoRail/AspView solution in time.

The other, [http://www.escapegreat.com/](http://www.escapegreat.com/), is using AspView, top to bottom.

Both sites seam to be working great. 

Gives me strength to continue the development on AspView, and find ways to improve it even better.
