I had tremendous fun coordinating work on the project, and I enjoy working with Monorail on my day job. I just do not have neither the time nor the attention to give the project anymore, and John is a much better fit, as he proved over the last few months with his efforts for the project.

So I treated myself to a one demanding hobby less.

I hope it will help me post more regularly now.

Interesting enough, I plan to do a few posts about recent performance issues I tackled in AspView. So I guess my MR days really aren't over yet :)
