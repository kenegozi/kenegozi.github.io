I'm downloading the whole package, letting Roee play with the WPF and Oren with WWF, leaving the WCF stuff to myself.I hope to have some insights on the subject, soon.The Linq preview is already installed, and I'm working on some minor project as part of my Bachelor's degree seminar, dealing with the impendency mismatch, between the software OO world and the database E-R world, using DLinq to demonstrate this kind of O/R mapping solution.
