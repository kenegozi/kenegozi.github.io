Following the worst job description ever, I've received an email I got today from a recruitment company, titles the same as this post.

Here is a (translated from Hebrew, structural and grammar weirdness transferred along) copy of the content:



We have an opening that might interest you or one of your friends.

Requirements:

- At least ten years developing/architecting WEB

- Experience with HTTP, JAVA SCRIPT, AJAX, XHTML, SOAP, DOM and more

- Startup/Multimedia/Video experience would make a substantial edge

And this is how I responded to that email:

Dear XYZ

If you'd be able to supply answers to these following questions:

- Who is the hiring company, what are they like?

- What does this company do? what is its primary product/market/services?

- What would be the hired person's responsibilities?

then I'd be able to say if this would interest me or my friends. Without that, there's just not enough data to know
