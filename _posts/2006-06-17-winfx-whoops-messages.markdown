I've came across a funny post at Paul Stovell's Blog, about the evolotion of error messages in the Visual Studio Family Products.

[http://www.paulstovell.net/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=2e18c36c-83ce-4483-8129-37f2cd9fcf26](http://www.paulstovell.net/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=2e18c36c-83ce-4483-8129-37f2cd9fcf26)

Give it a shot, and read the tech stuff there, too. Quite a good one and I recommend it.

Thanks to [Oren](http://www.lnbogen.com/) for pointing that out for me.
