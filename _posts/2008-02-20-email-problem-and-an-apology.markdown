I'm terribly sorry, but it seam that I've had a problem with my mail server, so during the last two month I did not receive any mail sent to my mail address on this domain.

I was able to access some of those now, and I'm going over the messages, so if you were waiting for a response regarding any Castle / AspView / Other issue, I hope Ill get in contact soon.
