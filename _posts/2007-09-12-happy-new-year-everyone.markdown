Some of you might know that [it's Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) tonight.



I wish you all a great year, filled with happiness, joy, and high quality code. May you need not debug code horrors this year ...



A year of improvement and becoming better at being who you are, and what you do.
