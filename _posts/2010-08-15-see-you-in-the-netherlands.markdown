I am going to be spending the next weekend and the following week in the Netherlands.

&#160;

So, if you know of a cool user group, geek get-together or whatnot, please let&#160; me know. Everything that has to do with web development (in any FW out there), large-scale systems, distributed data stores, agile processes, team leadership and management, ALM tools. 

&#160;

This is also a good opportunity if you are looking into a short consultation gig (a few hours) in one of the aforementioned areas, especially with MVC frameworks for .NET, client side JS/CSS guidance, setting up CI environment, DVCS usage and more. Give me a shout on email or through a comment on the blog (that will be kept private if you wish to)

I will mostly be in the area of Utrecht and Amsterdam, however I'll have a leased car so I guess that everywhere within a reasonable driving range is acceptable.
