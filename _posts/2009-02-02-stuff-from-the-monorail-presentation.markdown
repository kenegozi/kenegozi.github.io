Here is the promised presentation from the talk I gave yesterday, for the Web Developers Community at Microsoft offices in Ra'anana.









The sources for the demo I showed are hosted on github. If you're not using git (and you should give it a try if that is the case), you can grab a zip of the latest snapshot from that site (there's a 'download' button). Git is worth using if only for the great service given by github.

As for the slides - I tried using scribd and SlideShare, both attempts ended up not too well. I'll try to get a better format later on.





I'd like to thank [Noam King](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/noam/), the organiser of the WDC group, for having me as a speaker. I'd also like to thank [Damien Guard](http://damieng.com/) who have created the [Envy Code R font](http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released) which I used during the presentation.
