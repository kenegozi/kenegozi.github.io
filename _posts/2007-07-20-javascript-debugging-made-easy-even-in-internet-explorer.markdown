[This is why I'll be switching to VS2008](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/19/vs-2008-javascript-debugging.aspx), if [That](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/21/vs-2008-javascript-intellisense.aspx) was not enough.

As Scott keeps reminding us, it (VS2008) will be able to target multiple runtimes, so we can keep using that against .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0, no need to adapt 3.5 yet. (I wonder about targeting Mono from VS 2008 ...)

Until now, the JS debugging in VS was not too nice. Sure, I can use [FireBug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843), and thanks to [PrototypeJs](http://www.prototypejs.org/) I have almost no browser compatibility issues. However, sometime IE behaves strange, and I havn't found any decent way to breakpoint into js in IE.
