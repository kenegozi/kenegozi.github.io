Hadn't been writing a lot lately, even though exciting things were happening, especially in the AspView front (stay tuned).



Why, you ask?



Well, I'll tell you why.



Had a tooth implant on Sunday, and the antibiotics and pain killers were distracting me. [To the point of loosing time over extremely stupid mistakes](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2008/05/30/beware-of-sql-typos.aspx).



Anyway, I hope to fell better next week, and to have some spare time for writing some interesting stuff.
