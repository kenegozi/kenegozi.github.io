Scott Guthrie has recently posted [this](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/pages/ASP.NET-2.0-Tips_2C00_-Tricks_2C00_-Recipes-and-Gotchas.aspx). He is pointing out to a few dozens of posts about ASP.NET 2.0.

The stuff there ranges from UI tweaks, security, performance, VS2005 tips and more.

A "must be in the favorites or even as a desktop shortcut preferably with keyboard shortcut too" for everyone who deals with ASP.NET developing.
