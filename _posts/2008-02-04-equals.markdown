Yep, I've made yet another noob mistake.



I needed to compare two enum values, on a method that was accepting objects.



```
public string Whatever(object currentOption, object selectedOption){ return currentOption == selectedOption ? "class='active' " : string.Empty;}
```



Didn't work.





However, 

```
public string Whatever(object currentOption, object selectedOption){ return currentOption.Equals(selectedOption) ? "class='active' " : string.Empty;}
```

Did work.

so, it appear that == isn't polymorphic so it did the object.Equals method which apparently looks for reference equality, rather than the enum Equals.



And that has been yet another future-reference-post ...
