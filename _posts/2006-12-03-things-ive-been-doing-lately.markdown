I've been off the radar lately, due to some extensive work I do on a website for my employer.

It is still in early stages and I cannot talk about the site itself, but I can talk a little about the technology that drives it.

In one word: Castle.

In a few more words: 

Data Access and OR/m: Castle's ActiveRecord over NHibernate

Web UI Engine: Castle's MonoRail

ViewEngine: [AspView](http://kenegozi.com/blog/2006/11/27/AspViewRev38IsOut.aspx) (by yours truely, inspired by Ayende's [Brail](http://www.ayende.com/projects/brail.aspx)). All my spare time from work goes there.

Client Side Javascript stuff: [Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/) and [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/).

I really believe in the efforts made by Castle group, and I hope the the site I'm working on will be successful, as to serve for yet another prove of concept.



One more thing I'm doing last month, is that I've decided to finally end the thing with my Bachelor's degree. I needed to retake Linear Algebra I (yep, that one the all the non-bullet-time Matrixes ... I H-A-T-E adjoined matrixes. yuck) so that's actually why AspView doesn't progress as I'd want it too (and as some of my readers want, too).
