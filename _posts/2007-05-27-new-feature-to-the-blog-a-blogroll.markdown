just added a blogroll.

To the DB, to the Domain, to the controller and to the view.

Took me (all in all) 30 minutes, including all the coding, CSS-ing, uploading to the webserver, setting up the DB table on the hosted server, adding a few entries, clearing the browser's cache, and viewing it.

ah, and committing changes to Google code.



All of that was made in the Budapest Airport cafeteria, while waiting for my flight home (was a great trip. Photos, though not many of them, will be posted later on).



Rest assure that the DB access code is tested, and that the calls to the DB and to the cached data from the Controller and View are all typed.



I'd like to thank NHibernate, Castle and AspView (hey - that's me !), who made this possible.



I bet Ayende would have done it in 20 ...
