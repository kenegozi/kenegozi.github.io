Is the long awaited JS IDE will be VS2008?

Now it's a matter of adding ///<summery> tags to [prototype.js](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and maybe people would really stop being afraid of developing javascript code.

Now that's a good reason to switch to VS2008, combined with the fact than you [can hold to your current .NET distribution](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/06/20/visual-studio-2008-will-target-multiple-net-runtimes.aspx).
