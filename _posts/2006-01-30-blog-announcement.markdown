Hello everyone.


Welcome to my new blog.



This blog will contain my insights, thoughts, lessons I've learned and other stuff, about developing, design and architecture of Information Systems and Data Driven applications, in the .NET world. (and other stuff)



I'd like you to comment my posts whenever you have an alternative / similar / better /only idea or solution, to the problems I'll introduce in my posts from time to time, and I hope that even if you won't take an active part in this blog, you will enjoy an occasional reading, and that it would be a helpful tool for you to evolve as better IT Professionals.



The blog is still in it's babyish stages, and might change a bit in design during the next period. Comments on this account will be much appreciated, too.



All the best,



Ken Egozi.
