Not MS-Excel.



As if it was not enough that wife has graduated her B.A. with honors, now she has just given a notice that she is about to gain honors on her M.A. studies, too.

And as if that's not enough, during the course of the studies, she has been employed at 80%-100%.

And now she starts looking at doing a Ph.D.



Now I feel the urge to complete my damn Bachelor's (and I'm around 84, so no honors for me), and learn so much, and code that much so I'd become a greatgood better-than-I-am-now developer, and just to try and keep up.
