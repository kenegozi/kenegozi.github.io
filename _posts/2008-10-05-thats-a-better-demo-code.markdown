Lately [I ranted a bit](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2008/09/23/msdn-killed-my-using-directive.aspx) about the responsibility of community leaders, to not present totally crappy code, at least not without a disclaimer.



[This is a better way of doing that](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-google-maps-geocode-service-to.html). Another great post from Mike.



I might have also try-catch-ed the 

```
(HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url)
```
bit, but anyway that's good code for people to copy&amp;paste into their project without leaving HttpWebResponses and other Streams in danger of hanging loose.
