Lately there has been a major refactoring work being done on MonoRail, as part of the effort toward a release hopefully later this year. As of today, AspView's trunk is once again compatible with Castle's trunk.

As usual, code's [here](http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/viewengines/aspview/trunk/), binaries are [here](http://www.aspview.com/).
