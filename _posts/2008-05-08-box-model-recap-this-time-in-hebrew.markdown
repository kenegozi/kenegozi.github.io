Over two year ago, I have posted [about the un-orthodox box model that IE6 is using](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2006/02/19/understanding-the-box-model-of-html-elements.aspx). 

Yesterday I saw that Ohad Aston (an Israeli Web developer who blogs in Hebrew at the Israeli MSDN blogs site) [has written a Hebrew explanation to the same phenomena](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/ohadaston/archive/2008/05/08/css-box-model.aspx), so if you do web, especially using ASP.NET and can read Hebrew, I recommend that you take a peek. And if you're there, subscribe to his RSS. I did.
