Usually I won't just link to a post, however [go and read this post from Andre Loker is is a good one, and the title says it all](http://blog.andreloker.de/post/2008/05/MonoRail-AspView-and-ReSharper-skip-ViewAtDesignTime.aspx).



A quote from there, just as appetiser:

if you use [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (and youshould) you can skip the ViewAtDesignTime class altogether and just use the AspViewBase class (or a derived class) in the view. ReSharper will still provide Intellisense. The list of members is much more reliable as those members will definitively be available during compilation.





All in all, Andre's blog is good reading. Added to my rss-reader of choice.
