A cute programming languages quiz.

It'd show you 12 snippets of code, and you'd have to guess the programming language the code is written in.

If you have only started coding in the late 90's then you're in trouble.

heck, even if you have started on late 80's. I mean, really.

As I've been exposed to programming from a very early age, on the first half of the 80's, and my father being and old time punching-cards hacker, and I also tend to reach for the new stuff these days, I managed to score a nice rounded 12/12 100 points.

Can you?
