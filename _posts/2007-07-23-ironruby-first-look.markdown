That one is just a link to [ScottGu's post on IronRuby](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/23/first-look-at-ironruby.aspx).

Now I really need to make sure AspView can handle more languages, as I see IronRuby a natural candidate to be hosted within the AspViewEngine.

If I only had some more free time ...

(Note that it's a call for people who can make it happen. AspView is OSS, so you can give it a shot)
