Usually I won't just link to another's post, but [this one is a very good introductory level Unit Testing 101 Article](http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2007/12/20/foundations-of-programming-part-5-unit-testing.aspx), covering basics of the idea, and basic of nUnit and Rhino.Mocks.



A must read for Unit Testing newbies.
