Check out [this nice tool](http://regionerate.net/) from [Omer Rauchwerger](http://blog.rauchy.net/).



It could help a team to manage a coding convention. Should be very useful in Open Source environments. For example, when committing changes to castle project (or sending a patch) there is a [coding standard](http://www.castleproject.org/community/codingstandards.html) than needs to be followed. Regionerate could help a lot with that effort.



I need to see if it can select methods and properties by attributes. It could then help making MonoRail controllers and ActiveRecord decorated classes more readable (region of all actions with a "SkipFilterAttribute", region of "Property" and region of "HasMany", etc.)



UPDATE:

Silly me, I forgot to mention that [I found about this great tool at Roy Osherov's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/24/regionerate-free-code-layout-addin-for-vs-net.aspx). A very good one, that is. Many [Agile related stuff](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/tags/Agile/default.aspx), and [funny little things](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/21/que-sera-sera-a-song-about-agile-development.aspx), too.
