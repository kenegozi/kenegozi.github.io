I've been looking at getting a new laptop lately.

Currently my options are:

 Dell Latitude 830 (15")

 Dell XPS 15"

 Sony Vaio CR (14.1")



I'll probably go for a 8300/7500 cpu. 

Centrino 2 rigs on Sony site are only for 13" and 16", and I've seen none on Dell's site





My main concern is with the clarity of the screen.

I am very happy with my Toshiba screen (Tecra A3 15", matt, 1024X768). I don't like the new trends of high resolution (tiny fonts) and glossy screens (I want to see my code, not my face. I'm too damn pretty - it's distracting).



Any input is welcome
