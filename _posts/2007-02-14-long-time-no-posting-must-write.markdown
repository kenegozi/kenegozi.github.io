I haven't written much lately, since I was:

a. Learning for my final exam so I'd get my Bachelor's Degree at this decade.b. Under a lot of preassure at work, since we have a cool web2.0 thingie approaching a public beta real soon (will be followed).c.Sneasing my heart out, darn flew.d.Got into a new project at my personal business. This one is driven by Castle's ActiveRecord+MonoRail+AspView, and due to the client's request it'll use Access as the backend DB, and that would be a first-time-ActiveRecord/access for me. I still hope to convince him to at-least go for embedded FireBird.

So, stay tuned to some experiences with AspView, and hopefully in about a month you'll havetwo MonoRail/AspView driven websites out in the open. I am excited. Are you?
