One of the goals of this blog is for me to be able to get feedback from other people. Usually it means feedback regarding code I write, design decisions I make, and other technical stuff. 

However one other goal is to improve my written English skills. Therefore I would be happy to accept any input regarding spelling, vocabulary and grammar mistakes. I won't be offended, that's a promise.
