Argueable, but smart and funny.

If you're into Programming Languages, read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html). You can agree or disagree, but it would open your mind. Even if you won't be convinced, you'd have better arguments to stay on your way.

btw, ppl there seam to imply that all the said arguments are valid for C# as well as Java, but I think that C#3.0 is going in the right way to be more dynamic, yet robust and strict enough to be standartized among different developers.
