taken from [Karl Seguin](http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin) post about his [.net wishlist](http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2007/06/15/my-net-wishlist.aspx):

Thinking beyond the common request to implement an MVC pattern, I'd be great if the ASP.NET team could rethink the current model and life cycle. It leaks badly in any complicated scenario. 6 years after its release, I still don't fully understand it, and I'm ready to bet that I'm in the overwhelming majority. The only time it doesn't leak is when you don't need any of the fancy stuff it tries to do. I'm almost at the point where I just don't use .NET if I'm building a heavy web-based application. Forget learning an O/R mapper, test driven development or understanding domain driven development, the single best thing any ASP.NET developer can learn right now is MonoRail.

Could not agree more ...
