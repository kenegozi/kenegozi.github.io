From Castle Project users group:





I've just built the trunk yesterday (rev 3812). 

Main reason: I needed the BaseControllerTest from Castle.MonoRail.TestSupport.

The build was targeting .NET 2.0, in release, and no tests were run.

You can download it from: [http://kenegozi.com/Castle_r3812_net-2.0_release_not_tested.zip](http://kenegozi.com/Castle_r3812_net-2.0_release_not_tested.zip)Note that it is not tested, so use it at your own risk. If you're not going production this week, it should not be a problem ...
