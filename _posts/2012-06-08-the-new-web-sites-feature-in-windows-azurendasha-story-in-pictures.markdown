## scale it

[![websites-portal-scale-it](http://kenegozi.com/blog/uploaded/windows-live-writer/the-new-web-sites-feature-in-windows-azu_f8e5/websites-portal-scale-it_thumb.png)](http://kenegozi.com/blog/uploaded/windows-live-writer/the-new-web-sites-feature-in-windows-azu_f8e5/websites-portal-scale-it.png)



Have you noticed the “reserved” option? you could actually scale it to a dedicated VM (or a few), using the exact same simple deployment model. 



And of course it's not only for text files. you could run PHP, node.js, as well as the more expected ASP.NET stack, on top of this.



## want it

The Web Sites feature is still in preview mode. To start using Preview Features like Virtual Network and Web Sites, request access on the 'Preview Features' page under the 'account' tab, after you log into your Windows Azure account.
