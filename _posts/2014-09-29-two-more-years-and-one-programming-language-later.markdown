Two more years have passed. [Last time]({% post_url 2012-10-11-two-years-and-one-baby-later%}) both Noam and Alma were still just playing with [BabySmash](http://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/). These days however Noam is taking his first steps into programming:

With the help of this great book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290920/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617290920&linkCode=as2&tag=kenego-20&linkId=JSNYITUJ3WLAAGYS"><span>Hello World!: Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners</span><br/><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1617290920&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=kenego-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kenego-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1617290920" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> he is starting to realize important concepts such as variable, strings vs numbers, and soon enough we will be going into control flow and loops.

Not very different from [how I started]({% post_url 2008-08-03-how-did-i-get-started-in-software-development %}), time will tell if it will stick with him, and whether his siblings are going to join the party as well.

Even if none of them will end up with a career in software engineering, programming skills are superbly useful in almost any line of work these day, and probably even more so by they time they would enter the workforce, so I'll be doing my best to help them be ready, and have tons of fun while doing so.
