The Static SiteMap Generator's home is in Castle Contrib, and it's named Castle.Tools.StaticMapGenerator



I've just commited it to the repository, so it's at http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/Castle.Tools.StaticMapGenerator/trunk/



UPDATE (22/06/2008):The source has slightly moved (to a sub folder):[http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/Tools/Castle.Tools.StaticMapGenerator/](http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castlecontrib/Tools/Castle.Tools.StaticMapGenerator/)



I hope to have time soon to blog about the creation of this little tool, and of the usage. Also, expect a binary soon.
