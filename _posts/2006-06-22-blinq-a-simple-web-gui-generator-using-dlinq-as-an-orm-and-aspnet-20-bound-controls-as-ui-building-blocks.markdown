If you're into automated generation of data manipulation UI, then you must check out BLinq, written by Polita Paulus of Microsoft, at [http://www.asp.net/sandbox/app_blinq.aspx?tabid=62](http://www.asp.net/sandbox/app_blinq.aspx?tabid=62)

In short, it uses DLinq to generate a DAL, and then builds simple ASP.NET pages using GridView and DetailsView Controls (developed by Polita herself), to manipulate all of the tables from the database.

In my opinion, it serves as a great prove of concept for the whole ASP.NET and Linq technologies, as the fastest RAD tool for web application development.

Just build a database, and in an eye Blinq, you have a way to manipulate it through web app.

I find it great. Aren't you?
