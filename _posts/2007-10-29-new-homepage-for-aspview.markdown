I've just setup a brand new site for AspView.



It's main purpose is to aggregate AspView related data to one central location. It would contain links to AspView related posts from this blog and others, links to online documentation and samples.



There'd be also a "download" page containing the latest builds to be used with Castle RC3 and Castle trunk.



The site's link is (surprise surprise): [http://www.aspview.com](http://www.aspview.com)
