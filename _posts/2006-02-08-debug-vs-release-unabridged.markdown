In a lecture I've recently gave in our company, I've discussed aboutthe differences between Debug and Release builds, and ways to change the standard VS.NET configurations to better suit our build needs.

I'll post the important stuff hereduring the next few days, including some links, diagrams and other things that will make the things as clearer as can be.

Please visit here again in the next days to see the post, and comment me for any mistakes I may have, or any other suggestions in that area.

Crash all the bugs (was that your auntie?)
