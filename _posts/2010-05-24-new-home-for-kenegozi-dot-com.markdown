I've just completed moving my server from [GoGrid](http://gogrid.com) to [http://softsyshosting.com/](http://softsyshosting.com/) (thx to [Mike Nichols](http://devlicio.us/blogs/mike_nichols/) for the tip).

GoGrid were great. They have a very good customer service, the control panel is amazing and the options and flexibility are simply great. However the price was simply too much. I'm now getting twice as RAM for half the price, and since I do not plan to expand to multiple instances anytime soon, the flexibility and load-balancing options of GoGrid are simply shiny but pricy.

Now since I had very little time to spend on the move, and since it wasn't a straight xcopy thing (as it's now on IIS7.5 and I needed to do some tweaks to the blog engine), I stopped creating any content until the new server was up, and DNS was updated all across.

Expect new posts shortly.
