I've revisited my [google-ajax-enabled search page](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/01/24/my-first-codeproject-article-is-up.aspx) (at [kenegozi.com](http://kenegozi.com)) 

![homepage](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/uploaded/Newdesigntomysearchpage_AFB1/homepage_thumb.png)



It can still look better of course, but it is much better than the former one.

Now I need to revisit my blog's design a wee bit ...



btw, I use this page as the home page on all my browsers. It makes googling much faster and productive, and you are all invited to use it for your search needs. I try to keep it as lightweight as possible so it would load as fast as possible. Suggestions etc. are always welcome.
