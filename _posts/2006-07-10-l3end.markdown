I'd like to recommend on a rock band named Bend, from NY city.

Established by a friend of mine, Yoav Erez, they make great indie rock music, and they're on a struggle for a first album.

From AcidPlanet.com: "Bend spent the winter of 2006 fine tuning its songs about love and life, building on the British pop influences of bands like Coldplay and Radiohead, who inspired the band's inception earlier that previous year."

Their website is at [http://bend.cc](http://bend.cc).

So listen to their demos on their site and on AcidPlanet, MySpace and Stage.co.il, and if you're in NY city, try to catch a show. I'm sure you won't be disappointed
