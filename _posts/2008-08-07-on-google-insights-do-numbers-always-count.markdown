A dude on the [ALT.NET Israel mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/altnetisrael/) has given the new Google Insights a few things to chew on.



For example, he's shown that there is much more interest in ASP.NET MVC over MonoRail.



So a wonder came up, whether one should choose a framework or a technology should it be highly searched for.



my take on the matter:

- even if many people have searched for A, they might have found it, and decided against it.
- even if many of them do like or work with A, it doesn't mean it's right for me.




I'd look for this type of people in the tech community.

People that:
- Are very professional, highly skilled, ones I do want to get help from;
- Have shown interest in helping the community, rather than asking questions.
- Can, on top of answering questions and giving advice, **fix and improve the said technology themselves or using my suggestions/patches on the spot thus improving my productivity**



No matter how you'd turn the search statistics, based on parameter 3 only, any OSS will be way ahead a closed source solution.



Gustavo Ringel also had a say:

I see a lot of articles about how to do stupid things with typed datasets, and much less about how to do great things with ORM's...should i had go for typed datasets instead of NHibernate or other ORM because i have more help of less skilled people?
