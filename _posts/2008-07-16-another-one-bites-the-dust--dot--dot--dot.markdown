[Hamilton Verissimo](http://hammett.castleproject.org/), the founder of [Castle Project](http://www.castleproject.org/), and an inspiration to myself and many others, would most probably serve as another great power in the DevDiv, which appear to be an awesome place to work at, more and more every day.

Way to go Hammett.
