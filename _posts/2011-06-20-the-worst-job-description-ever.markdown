The following screenshot is taken from what is probably the worst job description I have ever seen. And be reminded that I used to work for the HQ of a large recruitment firm, been a recruiting manager and technical screener for candidates, and that my wife has years of experience in HR. I have seen my fair share of crap, but this is the worst of it



My eyes are still bleeding, be warned before you click to the fullsize image.
