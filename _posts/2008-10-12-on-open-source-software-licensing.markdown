I happened to discuss Open Source licensing with a few peers lately, and being an active OSS user and committer, they've asked me to write down my take on the matter.



It took me a little while to get down to it, but [like many other things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development), doing stuff incrementally seems to be the best option. 



I'll try to cover the popular licenses. and those I have an opinion about.



disclaimer: I am *not* a legal advisor. I have never went to any law school, and the opinions in this series is based only on common sense and my ability to read English. 





The first post in the series is [OSS Licensing - terms and concepts](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2008/10/12/oss-licensing-terms-and-concepts.aspx)
