Last Thursday I was informed by the organizers of alt.net UK conference that they have managed to squeeze me in, so I immediatly booked a flight to London, and have attendet. 

I was superb, and I've written a few posts, but since I was not online during the last few days I had no chance of publishing 'em. Hopefully they'll get during the next few days.



A lot have also been piling up on my MonoRail and AspView "desktops" so I appreciate the patience of the users, and I promise to do my best to keep up with the requests and patches being sent to me ...
