In a good timing for the new year, I'm happy to announce new features to AspView.

I have dedicated a post for each so I'd have a way to reference those features, and for my dear readers to comment on each feature.

So, what's all the fuss about?
- Nested layouts [http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/nested-layouts.aspx](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/nested-layouts.aspx)
- New syntax for html encoded output [http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/html-encoded-output-in-view-templates.aspx](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/html-encoded-output-in-view-templates.aspx)
- Embedded script blocks inside a view[http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/embedded-script-blocks.aspx](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/2007/12/30/embedded-script-blocks.aspx)
