I just got an email from a friend (thx Zeev) which simply contained a single URL:

[http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm)

Couldn't come at a better time for me. We're in the process of hiring new extraordinary people here at SHC Israel, and this matrix helps formalizing the things we want our candidates to know.

so, if you believe you're a log(n) on quite a few of the fields, then please ping me
