I've just tried the [type speed test](http://www.typequick.com/ttest/testyourskills.html) that I had[read about on Aaron's blog](http://blog.eleutian.com/2007/09/15/TypingSpeed.aspx).



My results (not excelled I'm afraid):


YOUR RESULTS ARE:
Number of words typed: 145Test duration: 3 minSpeed: 48.6 words/min. (243 keystrokes/min.)Error penalty: 10Accuracy: 93.1%

For my defense I'd add that although I'm typing English since I was about 6 years of old, 90% of that typingwas inside of some kind of an IDE, and it was in languages such as BASIC, C and Pascal, rather than English. Only on the last year when I started blogging, the last half of a year when joined the Castle community, and the last couple of month of working at Music Glue, have I really done some proper typing in English...



So, maybe I typed slowly, but it was maintainable and testable.
