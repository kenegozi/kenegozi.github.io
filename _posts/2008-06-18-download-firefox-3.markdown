I really don't need to add anything, right?

Installed it myself today. Appear to be a bit faster, and to eat up less memory.



The Google Toolbar and FireFTP were updated automatically.



I needed to manually re-install [FireBug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) and [IE-Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419)



btw, does anybody know where did the Back and Forward buttons has gone to? Im using the keyboard usually, but sometimes (especially during in-office-lunch-time) I need to click the Back thing with the mouse



UPDATE: it appear that as part of the upgrade, FF3 has inherited my customised toolbars and that's why it was looking weird. So I right-clicked on the toolbar -> customise, the clicked "Restore Default Set". All the buttons came back, then I rearranged the toolbar to my liking.
