Needless to say that I did not like that message at all:

![Must install new version](http://kenegozi.com/Blog/uploaded/WindowsLiveWriter/MustIinstallthenewversion_1242C/c419eb4b-2729-4311-a756-3290cae8e798.png)

I liked the old UI better. Why can't I continue use it, and just skip the new stuff?
