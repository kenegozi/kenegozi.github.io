All right, not that big.

&#160;

I've set up a simple survey about what development machine you use at&#160; work. If you are self employed and are using your personal machine for paid work, please state that in the comments field.

&#160;

&#160;

It is located at [http://dev-machines.appspot.com/](http://dev-machines.appspot.com/), go ahead and click your way into there.

Some explanations:

in the CPU slot, choose the CPU you have. the nC/mT bit on the Core i7 is about how many Cores and how many Threads the CPU support. Most i7 cpus has two cores, with hyperthreading, so the OS reports 4 cpus. There are some 4 cores models (with HT â€“ the OS say 8) and a single model with 6 cores. You can browse [this Intel's page](http://ark.intel.com/Default.aspx) to get a feel about yours.

If you're on an AMD, then just try to match the nearest option. I am not familiar with current AMD models, sorry.

This is the first time I deploy to google's AppEngine, and the first time I am actually deploying python code as an application rather than automation scripts, so please be patient with possible failures.
