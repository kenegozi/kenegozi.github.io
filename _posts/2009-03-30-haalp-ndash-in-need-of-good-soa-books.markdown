hi guys and gals.    I'm in need of a good SOA book, especially in relation with highly scaleable web applications.     

What it should&#160; *not* contain:&#160; - HowTo use a specific technology/vendor tool/etc     

What it *should* contain    - detailed stuff about best practices, pitfalls, etc.     

&#160;

please drop a comment of send me an email
