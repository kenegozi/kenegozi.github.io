The SP1 of Visual Studio 2005 was out, and it was (almost) great.

Why almost? If you have tried to install it, then you must know. It takes a LOT of time to run. And it uses a LOT of resources. If you do not believe me, take a look at what [Ayende has been writing while installing it](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/2006/12/15/VSSP1WhatTheHELLIsItDoing.aspx).

Luckily, [Jon Gallowai](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) has [blogged about a patch to shorten the setup time](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/12/19/things-i-wish-i-d-known-before-i-installed-vs-2005-service-pack-1.aspx).

Take a look, if you care for you cpu time.
