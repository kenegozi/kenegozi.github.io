explanation (before the wife kills me): I have some free time in the coming months, so I'm looking for interesting consulting gigs.



So, if you're in a company / dev team, and looking for some help with Castle (Windsor, MonoRail), NHibernate, or general information system design and architecture advices or training, setting up build and test environments, or any other of the things I rant about in this blog, then I'm your guy. 

I also do web-client ninja work, dancing the crazy css/html/javascript tango (jQuery: yes, Ms-Ajax: no) 



I currently live in Israel, but I'm fine with going abroad for short terms if you're an off-shore client.
