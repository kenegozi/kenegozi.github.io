From the subversion commit comment:




Some refactoring to avoid code duplicationAdded support for CommentsAtom - a feed with all of the comments in a blog, used for tracking purposes by the blog writer  

  

Now you can access [http://the_blog_url/Syndication/CommentsAtom.aspx](http://the_blog_url/Syndication/CommentsAtom.aspx) and get a feed of all the comments.  

Useful as a tool for the blog writer, as it enables tracking of comments all overthe blog
