My poor old laptop has had a lot of problems lately, priming at ignoring any network connection yesterday and having many problems with svn and git sessions when the network was on, so I decided to re-install.

'twas 1am, so I thought 'what the heck - let's try this vista thing at last'.

&#160;

It was surprisingly a smooth experience. The initial setup identified almost all of the drivers, but the sound-card and the SD card reader. However, the auto updates (which took over an hour cuz there was apparently a lot to update) took care of the sound, and I got the SD driver from Texas Instrument's site.

What I had to install to make the machine workable for day-to-day work:

- Antivirus (AVG)
- VS2008
- R#4
- msysgit
- Windows Live (Messenger + Mail + Writer)
- TortoiseSVN
- FF3 + Firebug + IEtab + FireFtp + Google Toolbar
- Notepad2 (and making it a notepad replacement)


still missing (no time) but essential:

- SnagIt
- Camtasia Studio
- Launchy

btw, since I've installed VS2008 without going 2005 first and without the full SDKs, I ran into a problem with NAnt 0.86b1 - complaining about missing .NET 2.0 stuff.&#160; It appear to be a known bug in NAnt, that has been fixed back on late 2007, so I've just switched to a nightly build of 0.86b2 and the problem did go away.&#160; I need to make sure that it won't affect my Castle build.

Didn't have much to say here. I consider it a test post (see if Writer will work from Vista) but it beats the crap out of &quot;TEST POST PLEASE IGNORE&quot; ...
