Ayende has recently posted a walkthrough for building Web Apps using the Castle Project's libraries.

He covers ActiveRecord and MonoRail basics, showing off some of the shiny and new abilities (AR scaffolding, ARSmartDispatchers, Generics integration and so on).

The only thing missing is IoC-ing using Winsdor or even Binsdor. Maybe to hook some BL layer or something.

So it concludes (as of now) a [Part I](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/BuildingApplicationsUsingCastleRC2PartI.aspx), [Part II](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/BuildingApplicationsUsingCastleRC2PartII.aspx) , and [source-code](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/DemoCodeForCastleForumsDemoApp.aspx).

If you wanna see a decent web development framework at action - tune up to those posts.
