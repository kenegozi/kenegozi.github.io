I'll post here links for stuff that I find usefull, for people who are doing their first steps in the Castle's ActiveRecord's world.

This post is to be updated while finding more resources.

Note that this is not a replacement for the official ducomentation that can be found on Castle's website, but merely a place to do the beginner's life somewhat easier.
