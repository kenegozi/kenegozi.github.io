Josh Coffman over at [Computerist Solutions](http://computeristsolutions.com/) is running an [interesting series of interviews](http://computeristsolutions.com/blog/categories/interviews), asking people a few short and concise questions about their coding habits, preferences etc. Quite insightful, and he's bringing in interesting people who are extremely bright, very experienced, or both. And (at least until now) they are as polyglot as it gets.
