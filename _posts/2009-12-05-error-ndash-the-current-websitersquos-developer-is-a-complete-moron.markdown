It is even misspelled.

The funniestsaddest thing is the source of this page:

```
<script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot;> 
if (document.all) {
 document.writeln(...);}
else {
 document.writeln(&quot;<p><font color=\&quot;#999999\&quot;><b>Error ! The current browser is either too old or too modern (usind DOM document structure).</b></font></p>&quot;);}
</script> 
```

So many bad practices in a such a small snippet. And the stuff in the (â€¦) part was too painful to paste.
