77 tests, all green.

That's all new tests from the last week.

I think it's almost stable enough for releasing it on aspview.com

I'll just put the old tests back in (with Ignore) as regression tests, until I'm comfortable enough to remove.



So - custom base classes for views are just around the corner.

Right after that - better extensibility (through custom Pre Compilation Steps provider and MarkupTransformation Provider)



you can of course watch the progress on svn (it's all on the trunk, so if you're using trunk for production, please restrain yourself a few more days ...)



stay tuned ...
