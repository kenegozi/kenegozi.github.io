Another funny quote from Castle dev list:

Ayende (after a discussion on the lack of DynamicProxy documentation):Yes, the underlying assumption that by the time you are done understanding DP you don't have the strength to write docs.



If you wanna grok that, then you can look at a small snippet from DP2 code on the blog's title, or [browse the repo](http://svn.castleproject.org:8080/svn/castle/trunk/Tools/Castle.DynamicProxy2/)
