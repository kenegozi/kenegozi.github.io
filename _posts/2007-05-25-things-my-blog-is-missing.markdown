Since this blog is running on an engine that I wrote (available on Google code site, [here](http://code.google.com/p/kenegozi-weblog/)), it lack some features that more mature blog engines already have. (the other engines lacks the combined power of ActiveRecord/MonoRail/AspView ...)



So, that's currently my list:

1. Blogroll, for obvious reasons.

2. Email alert for me when anyone posts a comment for one of my posts.

3. Comments feed (via ATOM).

UPDATE - Done

4. Email subscriptions for new posts, or new comments on specific posts.

5. I have a problem with the font. I should fix the CSS but the Internet connection here (I'm at a Budapest hotel) is quite poor. Will be fixed next week.

UPDATE - Done



Any other suggestions?



note that I do not intent on implementing Pingbacks and Trackbacks, since those were littering my blog in the past.
