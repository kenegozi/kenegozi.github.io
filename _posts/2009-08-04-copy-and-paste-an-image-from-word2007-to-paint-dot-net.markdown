Scenario:
I got a docx document by email, with an image embedded inside.&#160; I needed to take it to Paint.NET for some cropping and resizing.&#160; Usually I'd copy the image, then “Paste as New Image” on Paint.NET (using Ctrl+Alt+V, or the Edit menu).
Problem:
Paint.NET did not recognize the clipboard content as a valid image.
Solution:
I pasted the image into the good ol' Paint.exe, then copied from there, and “Pasted as New” in Paint.NET

&#160;

voila.
