I want to release MonoRail as soon as I can.   In order to do so I will need some help from the community. Let me list the things currently missing:
- Visual Studio wizards - for creating a new project with one of the main view-engines, with or without WindsorExtension enabled.
- Visual Studio templates - for a Controller, a ViewComponent, and view templates for the various view engines (the template should include informative comments).
- Programmatic configuration. I've added IAspViewConfigurationEvents, and having the same for Brail and NV would be great. 

Any help with the above will be greatly appreciated.
