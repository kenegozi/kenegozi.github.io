I have loaded a [new homepage](http://kenegozi.com/), and used a little of the [Google AJAX Search API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation) to make it interesting. Actually, I'm using it now as my browser's default homepage, instead of google.com

Not only that, but I have documented the process of making it, and have sent it to [codeproject](http://www.codeproject.com/), to be published, as my first contribution there, in hope for more to come.

So, please leave your impressions, eiether here or in the codeproject article (I'll post the addresss once it will be up).
