[That's a big announcement](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/20/vs-2008-multi-targeting-support.aspx).

After all, even VS2005 was actually calling csc.exe rather that calling some magical inner stuff as in 2002/2003.

I hope that this also means better addin development support, so great projects like [CVSI](http://www.jonorossi.com/upload/cvsi.htm) and [ActiveWriter](http://www.altinoren.com/activewriter/), could become even better.

Do you think they'd enable a "Compile for Mono" option?
