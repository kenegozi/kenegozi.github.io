I've just got the announcement from the Ruby.NET team at QUT, about the new beta release, numbered 0.7.

The two major things in there:

1. the compiler now creates pdb files, which means that it can be debugged with the interactive debuggers, 

2. Visual Studio 2005 integration, including Ruby projects.

Can't wait to check this out.

I'd like to see if I can do some integration into the AspView project, to enable a RubyOnMonoRail thing. I guess it'd have to wait for the BCL integration, promised to be released around the end of this year, but it is quite interesting as it is right now.
