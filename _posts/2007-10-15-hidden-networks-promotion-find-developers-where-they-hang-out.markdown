The idea behind Hidden Networks is great.

They've added that simple job board (here, on the right. If you're on a feed reader, go the HTML version and look it up) that shows openings near the reader's (that's you) location.



That way, recruiters gets exposure on the places where developers who are interested in Learning New Stuff hang out.

If they read Ayende (or me), then you might want them for your team.



And now - there's a promotion code.

Quote that: 100OFF0710 

And get a 100$ off your first ad.

This offer is good until the end of the month (31/10/2007).
