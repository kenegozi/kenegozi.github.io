30, that is.



I've been snatched to birthday dinners all week, like it's not enough that Im on the most full-of-work time of my life. Non-urgent things (like improving AspView or taking a shower) got pushed aside. Just kidding, AspView is important enough ...



Sarit took me on a surprise vacation.

That's me at the Zavitan pools next to the waterfall:

As for "next year resolutions" - hmm, I did not put much thought in that so I'm just scribbling:

1. Complete the bachelor's degree. High time I did that;

2. Give at least three talks. I really enjoy sharing knowledge, and it also pushes me to know more on things I consider myself proficient in. First talk is already scheduled for 14 May, at ["The Developers Group"](http://www.richplum.co.uk/) meeting on Microsoft Victoria, London UK. I hope there'd more to come;

3. Delve into Silverlight 2.0;

4. Learn F#;

5. Increase my NHibernate skills;

6. Find time to contribute to Linq For NHibernate;

7. Continue pushing Castle forward. The whole stack. It's just great;

8. Do more sports (cycling and/or swimming);
