[This one made me laugh](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dg2z5whw_41cb322p). Apparently, [meetup](http://www.meetup.com) is trying to convince potential employees that working for them is even better than working for Google.

One of the best recruitment ads I've ever seen.

If they were not java-ing, I'd even consider applying ...



A little excerpt:




G: At Google, after you consume all the Google Food you can eat, you will enjoy Rear Cleansing, Front Cleansing, Dryer, and Oscillating options.You will not be forced to interact with those without ample access to Rear Cleansing, Front Cleansing, Dryer, and Oscillating options. 

M: At Meetup, there are no options when flushing the toilet.You will be forced to interact with the un-cleansed and un-oscillated. 


G: At Google, a few Googlers wish they were at a fast-growing company where they can personally still make a huge difference.

M: At Meetup, some Meetuppers wish we had a toilet like the Googleplex.
