Lately there has been some noise around the lack of documentation on the Castle project.



I have expressed my view on the matter on the mailing list, and in short I'd say that having an undocumented feature is way better than not having that feature at all.



During the ALT.NET UK conference, one of the guys approached me and said that he has solid background in technical documentation, and that he is willing to put some effort to that end.



I'm terrible with names, so I forgot his (sorry ...), but if it's you dear reader (or if it's not you, but you are willing to help with that) then please do contact me should you need any help in kicking it off.



Thanks a bunch,

Ken.
