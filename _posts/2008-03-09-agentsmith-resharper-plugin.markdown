From the website:

Current version includes following features: 

- 
Naming convention validation.

- 
XML comment validation.

- 
XML comment, string literals, identifiers and resources (.resx files) spell checking 

- 

Smart paste.







The coolest thing is the ability to spell check identifiers. I'd love it.



It's at [http://www.agentsmithplugin.com/](http://www.agentsmithplugin.com/) and I found out about it on Castle's dev list (thx Victor)
